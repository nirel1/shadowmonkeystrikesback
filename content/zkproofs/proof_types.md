# Primary 

1. range proofs: Prove that witness $x$ is in a given range $[\alpha, \beta]$.  
2. lookup proof: Given table $T$, prove that witness $x\in T$.  
3. copy proof: 
4. permutation proof: 

# Secondary 

5. linear interactive proofs 
6. Groth16: non-interactive linear proof (NILP) $\rightarrow$ split NILP $\rightarrow$ disclosure free NILP

> Renamed from 2-move algebraic input-oblivious linear interactive proof 
> Non-interactive proof for relation generator $\mathcal{R}$ if it has perfect completeness and statistical knowledge soundness against affine prover
> strategies.
