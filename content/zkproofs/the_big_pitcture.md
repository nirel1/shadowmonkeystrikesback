# Motivation 

This is where we can talk about the big picture of constructing PIOP-based proof systems. Like PLONK article from scroll, but with more abstraction. I
think the main trouble here is that we are going to have to actually taxonomize all the various proof systems, which will require understanding them
in detail. We can do small parts at a time. The idea is to give a higher level view and then use the individual articles to explain various
components.
