# Guide 

The goal of this page is to understand the mechanics of modern general-purpose zero knowledge proof systems. We will not necessarily detail each proof
system in its entirety. Rather, we aim to give a modular overview of the various components of these proof systems and the concepts involved. In some
cases this will mean in depth distillations of certain constructions. In others, however, this will mean a breakdown of why we need a particular tool
in the zk toolkit and what the most recent advances on that front are.
