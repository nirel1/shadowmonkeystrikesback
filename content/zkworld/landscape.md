# Introduction 

The goal here is to give an overview of the current landscape of proof systems. Ideally, to generate my own taxonomy. Most proof system papers will be
referenced here. ZKProofs section is more about the techniques that are used in these papers, not necessarily about the fully detailed constructions
themselves. We can talk specifically about how these systems differ here (but only at a high level). Ideally, we can also mention the developer
environment as well. 

# Taxonomy
