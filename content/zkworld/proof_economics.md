# Where Are Proofs In Economic Taxonomy? 

**Potential Claim:** Proofs are a fundamentally new form of economic object. *If so, then we will need some new ideas in order to model their
behavior*. 

# Individual Decision Making in Games of Incremental Certainty 

Knowledge assumptions are essential in most game theoretic models. However, here the emphasis is usually placed on modelling behavior in the context 
of various types of uncertainty. A player's utitlity function is thereby optimized with respect to a distribution of outcomes dependent on this
uncertainty. In situtations where relevant knowledge is partitioned and can either be hoarded by players or selectively disclosed via zero-knowledge
in a computationally secure manner, then, while equilibria may not shift, their likelihood may. Collaboration in this context becomes interesting to
anlyze as players do not need to trust each other in order to trust the information they learn via proof. For some player $p$ there may be a set of
optimal equilibria. Influencing the game (through her own decisions) such that these equilibria are more likely to come about might require collaboration 
with some other player $p'$ with knowledge that $p$ needs but otherwise wouldn't have. Rationality in the context of "zero knowledge signaling" may
incentivize coalition formation. Analyze following with zero knowledge signaling to see potential results?
