# Introduction 

There are too many assumptions to keep track of. I keep forgetting which assumption comes from where and is applicable in what context. Cryptography
is notoriously difficult to keep up with because new assumptions are constantly being proposed in order to gain more and more functionality. The goal
of this page is to keep track of various assumptions as and when I read about them. They can then be referenced in the future with some clarity. I
have not come across anything like this in my cryptographic travels, but would have found it very useful if I had. So, here we are.
