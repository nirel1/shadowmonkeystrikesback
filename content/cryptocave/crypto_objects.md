title: Directory of Cryptographic Objects

# Guide 
The other pain point I have found while attempting to study cryptography is that there is a vast ocean of cryptographic objects and that they are all
useful for different contexts, can be constructed from different assumptions, andoffer different security guarantees. I will attempt here to keep a
working directory of cryptographic objects. Where possible, I will provide an overview of their construction and an intuition for their
security/efficiency guarantees. Perhaps more useful will be a description of how these objects are used in the wild.  

# Directory
