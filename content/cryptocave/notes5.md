Note 5 - on-chain proofs

Smart contracts have inherently been a dream of fairness and automation (it’s in the name), with the promise of executing agreements without any human involvement. As it turns out, this isn’t always useful - a lot of agreements rely on information that is not (yet) stored on blockchains. The growth of proofs being verified on-chain will be a cool test of whether this concept can be challenged while minimizing trust on other humans. While oracles are cool, they don’t filter for correct information, because there really is no way to do so. With proofs, there seem to be a subset of information (given by computation) where correct information can actually be guaranteed, and the hope is that this can increase the design space for blockchains. Automated bug bounties are one such idea. Credit scoring (spectral finance) is another.
