## Problem
I can't build my own decentralized network without designing a blockchain from scratch.

## Solution
cosmos-sdk, polkadot, avalanche: Design a blockchain with custom consensus, validators, token / staking / inflation, custom rules, gas fees, rules built into the chain instead of smart contracts, custom execution environment / devx for developers
