# Introduction 

This will be a running place to try and understand elliptic curves. I don't have a cohesive picture, but will try and keep some random notes here
until I can compile them into something tangible. 

1. Hasse's Theorem 
2. Frobenius Endomorphism 
3. Legendre Symbol
4. Jacobi Sums 
5. Schoof's Algorithm 
6. Supersingular Curves
