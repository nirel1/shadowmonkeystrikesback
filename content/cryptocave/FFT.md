# Why We Care About FFTs  

> "FFTs require linear space-complexity for the prover, and prevent the prover from being implemented in logarithmic space as in the sumcheck protocol
> or other succinct arguments based on folding protocols. In contrast, we reduce $\mathsf{NP}$ statements to bilinear relations such as scalar-product
> relations, and then rely on succinct arguments for scalar products; this reduction can be performed via a linear number of cryptographic operations,
> and without relying on FFTs."
