# Definitions 

**Def Group.** A group is a set along with an associative (also sometimes called "binary") operation. Usually, this operation is referred to as
addition. Formally, a group is denoted $G = (G, +)$. $G$ contains an "identity" element, referred to as $0_{G}$. Finally, all elements of $G$ 
have inverses.  

**Def Ring.** A ring is a set along with two operations, usually referred to as addition $(+)$ and multiplication $(\times)$. Formally, a ring is
denoted $R = (R, +, \times)$. $R$ commutes under addition. Multiplication is distributive with respect to addition. $R$ has an additive identity 
$0_{R}$ and a multiplicative identity $1_{R}$. Lastly, all elements have additive inverses, but do not necessarily have multiplicative inverses. 

**Isomorphism Theorems for Rings:**
    1. *First Isomorphism Theorem (RIT1).*
    2. *Second Isomorphism Theorem (RIT2).*
    3. *Third Isomorphism Theorem (RIT3).* 

**Def Zero Divisor.** $a \in R$ is called a left zero divisor of ring $R$ if $\exists x \in R$ such that $x \ne 0$ and $a \times x = 0$. Similarly,
$a$ is called a right zero divisor if $x \times a = 0$. If $a$ is either a right or left zero divisor, it is generically referred to as a zero
divisor. If it is both a left and right zero divisor, then it is referred to as a two-sided zero divisor. If $R$ is commutative (with respect to
multiplication), then all zero divisors are two sided. That is, left and right zero divisors are the same.   

**Remark.** In many cases, it is useful to identify which elements in some ring have multiplicative inverses. Understanding zero divisors is important
in this context, as demonstrated by the below fact. 

**Fact.** Let $R$ be a finite commutative ring. If $r \in R$ is not a zero divisor, then $r$ has a multiplicative inverse. 

*Proof.* 

**Def Integral Domain.** An integral domain is a ring with no zero divisors that is commutative with respect to multiplication. 

**Def Field.** A field is an integral domain with multiplicative inverses.
