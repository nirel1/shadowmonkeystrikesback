<p><strong>Def Group.</strong> A group is a set along with an associative (also sometimes called &ldquo;binary&rdquo;) operation. Usually, this operation is referred to as
addition. Formally, a group is denoted $G = (G, +)$. $G$ contains an &ldquo;identity&rdquo; element, referred to as $0_{G}$. Finally, all elements of $G$
have inverses.</p>
<p><strong>Def Ring.</strong> A ring is a set along with two operations, usually referred to as addition $(+)$ and multiplication $(\times)$. Formally, a ring is
denoted $R = (R, +, \times)$. $R$ commutes under addition. Multiplication is distributive with respect to addition. $R$ has an additive identity
$0_{R}$ and a multiplicative identity $1_{R}$. Lastly, all elements have additive inverses, but do not necessarily have multiplicative inverses.</p>
<p><strong>Isomorphism Theorems for Rings:</strong>
1. <em>First Isomorphism Theorem (RIT1).</em>
2. <em>Second Isomorphism Theorem (RIT2).</em>
3. <em>Third Isomorphism Theorem (RIT3).</em></p>
<p><strong>Def Zero Divisor.</strong> $a \in R$ is called a left zero divisor of ring $R$ if $\exists x \in R$ such that $x \ne 0$ and $a \times x = 0$. Similarly,
$a$ is called a right zero divisor if $x \times a = 0$. If $a$ is either a right or left zero divisor, it is generically referred to as a zero
divisor. If it is both a left and right zero divisor, then it is referred to as a two-sided zero divisor. If $R$ is commutative (with respect to
multiplication), then all zero divisors are two sided. That is, left and right zero divisors are the same.</p>
<p><strong>Remark.</strong> In many cases, it is useful to identify which elements in some ring have multiplicative inverses. Understanding zero divisors is important
in this context, as demonstrated by the below fact.</p>
<p><strong>Fact.</strong> Let $R$ be a finite commutative ring. If $r \in R$ is not a zero divisor, then $r$ has a multiplicative inverse.</p>
<p><em>Proof.</em></p>
<p><strong>Def Integral Domain.</strong> An integral domain is a ring with no zero divisors that is commutative with respect to multiplication.</p>
<p><strong>Def Field.</strong> A field is an integral domain with multiplicative inverses.</p>
<p><strong>Def Characteristic.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Def Field Extension.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Def Finite Field.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Def Module.</strong></p>
