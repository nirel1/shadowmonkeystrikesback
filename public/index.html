<p>My name is Prashanth. I&rsquo;m a currently a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University. My main interests revolve around cryptography. In particular,
I have an affinity for post-quantum zero-knowledge proofs. I am additionally taken by cooperative game theory, network theory, and various niches of
mathematical modeling. No matter how foolish, I enjoy mathematizing human processes &ndash; trust in the case of cryptography, collaboration in the case of
cooperative game theory, and socialization in the case of network theory. Indeed, the intersection of these subjects has much to say about how we
might optimize for the types of futures on offer. Occasionally, I attempt amateur philosophy and political polemics. I&rsquo;m almost always wrong when I
do, but that doesn&rsquo;t stop me from trying to convince people I&rsquo;m not. Otherwise, for the sake of sanity, I climb and play jiu-jitsu.</p>
